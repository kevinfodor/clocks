Code to test various clocks under Linux (and OSX)
=======================================

Ref: [Clock Sources in Linux](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2014/02/18/clock-sources-in-linux/)

Run as:

	taskset -c 1 ./clocks <cpu_freq_ghz> <output_file>

Some quick notes on the code:

-   The ClockTest.sh script compiles the code, and executes the test programs.
    It uses taskset to ensure that the tests don't migrate to different CPUs.
    (taskset is done only for the C++ test – the JVM uses so many threads that
    pinning them all to a single CPU is probably not a good idea). You'll need
    to modify the script to specify the correct location for JAVA_HOME on your
    system, or set JAVA_HOME prior to calling the script.

-   The script detects whether the rdtscp instruction is available by querying
    /proc/cpuinfo. If not, it bypasses that code (which would otherwise throw a
    SIGILL).

-   You can also pass in the CPU frequency, in GHz. If you don't, then a
    frequency of 1 is used, which has the effect of returning the tick count
    unmodified for those clock sources that use tick counts (i.e., anything
    having to do with the RDTSC instruction).

-   If the script doesn't seem to be working, execute it with “bash -xv
    ClockTest.sh” to see the actual commands.
